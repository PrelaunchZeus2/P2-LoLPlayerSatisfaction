Polarity is a value between -1 and 1 that describes the positivity or negativity of the statement. -1 means the statement is very negative, 1 means the statement is positive, and a score of zero indicates the statement is neutral. Subjectivity is a value between 0 and 1 that describes the factuality of the statement. A score of 0 means the statement is or refers to factual information while a score of 1 mean that the statement is likely a personal opinion. These scores will be calculated and appended to our data frame as seperate columns"
